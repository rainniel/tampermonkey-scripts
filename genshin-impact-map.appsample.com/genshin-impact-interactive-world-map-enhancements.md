### Features
- Makes everything markable, except for Teleporters & Waverider waypoints.
- Automatically toggles on **Hide Found Markers** on page load (For logged-in users only).
- Adds a **Hide Found Markers** on/off toggle button in the sidebar menu, allowing you to easily show/hide marked markers (For logged-in users only).
- Moves the comment image pop-up to the left side, ensuring the selected marker probably on the center of your screen is not fully covered by the pop-up.
- Removes the right sidebar.
- Removes the blue focus border around the map.

**Notice:** Please wait for the map to fully load before switching to another tab. If you visit the site and immediately switch tabs, leaving the map to load in the background, this script might not work as intended.

### Known issue
If markers are **not markable**, restart your browser or clear the site cache. The marker data is probably already cached in the browser, preventing the script from intercepting and modifying it properly to make everything markable.
